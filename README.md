Caterpillar
===========

OpenGL program demonstrating the use of lighting on spheres making a caterpillar.
The arrow keys can be used to make the caterpillar crawl.

Directions:

  		use W A S D keys to rotate the caterpillar.
 			W and S rotate on the x-axis
 			A and D rotate on the y-axis

 		use arrow keys to make the worm crawl around
 			rotations are reset upon crawling because it
 			is dificult to control the caterpillar if it is
 			rotated at an awkward angle

 		use keys 1 2 and 3 to toggle the three lights on and off
